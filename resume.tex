    \textsl{B.A., Mathematics and East Asian Studies} \hfill \textbf{Sep 2008 -- May 2012}\\
    Received highest honors for senior thesis analyzing over 200,000 Chinese
    blog posts, algorithmically detecting mutations in the Chinese language in
    response to censorship. Completed coursework in abstract algebra,
    Galois theory, topology, real and complex analysis, probability theory, and
    linguistics.

    \section{\mysidestyle Professional\\Experience}

    \textbf{Authentic Artists}, San Francisco, CA \vspace{2mm}\\\vspace{1mm}%
    \textsl{Director of Machine Learning} \hfill \textbf{Sep 2019 -- present}\\
    Lead a remote (US-based) engineering team to build AI-powered audiovisual
    experiences, including a cloud deep learning server for song generation, a
    C++ constraint/transformation library for imposing additional musical style
    on deep learning output, an automated Max/Ableton session for audio
    generation, and a dynamic Unreal scene to generate music videos. Coordinated
    with creative and executive teams to balance engineering and IP development
    with artistic and business goals.

    \textbf{Cairn Labs}, Salt Lake City, UT \vspace{2mm}\\\vspace{1mm}%
    \textsl{President and Founder} \hfill \textbf{Jan 2016 -- Feb 2020}\\
    Lead a cross-functional team of 4-6 to design and build software
    for clients, with a focus on applications that integrate
    state-of-the-art NLP and machine learning. Notable projects include:

    \begin{itemize}
    \item A deep learning based conversational UI framework to power
      will.i.am's new wireless earphones and other applications. Backed by
      Python, Tensorflow, and other technologies. Supports multiple languages,
      extensible dialogue flows, and includes a type system that integrates with
      a custom knowledge base. Our software had a significant role in the
      success of the client's recent \$117M fundraising round
      (\url{https://goo.gl/iMvVTt}).
    \item An intelligent agent for a healthcare client that performs realtime
      conversational analysis from raw audio. Uses an open source library I
      built for training and serving machine learning models from Elixir
      (\url{https://github.com/cairn-labs/mlem}).
    \item A risk scoring server for a client in the car insurance industry,
      collecting realtime driving data and assigning machine-learning based
      driver risk scores at a rate of 3000+ qps.
    \item An advertising server to display appropriate concert ticket offers
      to users, based on user-level and page-level contextual targeting. Backed
      by Elixir/Phoenix, Python, PostGIS, and React.js.
    \end{itemize}

    \textbf{Google}, Venice, CA \vspace{2mm}\\\vspace{1mm}%
    \textsl{Software Engineer III} \hfill \textbf{Jun 2014 -- Mar 2016}\\
    Worked on a small team using natural language processing and other machine
    learning techniques to improve advertisement quality. Led a 20\% project
    related to mining semantic information from web data, which was adopted by
    several teams across different product areas. Built a named entity
    recognition system in C++ and a link detection algorithm that runs on very
    large graphs; contributed to a topic model for clustering semantic entities.

    \textbf{Whisper}, Venice, CA \vspace{2mm}\\\vspace{1mm}%
    \textsl{Software Engineer and Data Scientist} \hfill \textbf{Mar 2013 -- Apr 2014}\\
    Sole data scientist at a rapidly expanding social media startup
    seeing upwards of three billion monthly pageviews. Designed and built an NLP
    service to extract topics and tags from posts, predict image searchterms
    from unstructured text, and target content to users. Implemented a new
    geographic search system using PostGIS that decreased search time by
    90\%. Worked closely with the front and backend development teams, writing
    production code in Erlang and Python.
